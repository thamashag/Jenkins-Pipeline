# Jenkins-Pipeline

Stage 1: Build

* Description: In this stage, you compile and package your code into a deployable artifact.
* Tool: You can use build automation tools like Maven, Gradle, or Ant depending on your project's technology stack. For example, if you're working with Java, Maven is a common choice.
  
Stage 2: Unit and Integration Tests

* Description: This stage ensures your code functions correctly at both the unit and integration levels.
  * Tools:
    * For unit testing: You can use frameworks like JUnit (for Java), pytest (for Python), or the testing framework provided by your programming language.

Stage 3: Code Analysis

* Description: This stage analyzes your code for adherence to coding standards, potential bugs, and maintainability.
* Tool: Consider using code analysis tools like SonarQube, Checkstyle, or ESLint (for JavaScript) depending on your programming language.
  
Stage 4: Security Scan

* Description: This stage scans your code for security vulnerabilities to identify potential threats.
* Tool: Use security scanning tools like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, or Snyk depending on your application's needs. OWASP ZAP is commonly used for web application security testing.
  
Stage 5: Deploy to Staging

* Description: Deploy your application to a staging environment that closely resembles your production environment. This allows you to perform further testing before deploying to production.
* Tool: Use deployment automation tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or platform-specific tools like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Azure App Service depending on your infrastructure.
  
Stage 6: Integration Tests on Staging

* Description: Run integration tests on the staging environment to ensure the application works seamlessly in a production-like setting.
* Tool: Continue using the integration testing tools mentioned in Stage 2, adapting them to test your application in the staging environment.
  
Stage 7: Deploy to Production

* Description: Deploy your application to the production environment once it has passed all previous stages successfully.
* Tool: Use the same deployment automation tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, or Azure tools) to ensure a consistent and reliable deployment process.
